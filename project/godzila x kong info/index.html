        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>A Monarch observation outpost stationed in Hollow Earth picks up an unidentified signal. On the surface,
            the signal causes Jia, the last known survivor of the Iwi tribe from Skull Island, to experience
            hallucinations and visions, causing her adoptive mother, Dr. Ilene Andrews, to worry. Also sensing the
            signal, Godzilla leaves Rome and attacks a nuclear plant in France to absorb radiation. He then heads to
            the lair of the Titan, Tiamat in the Arctic. Monarch believes Godzilla is strengthening himself for an
            oncoming threat.</p>
